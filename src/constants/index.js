/*
  Always use values from Constants instead of raw values

    1. It's easier to read and understand (For example you can see all possible types of a variable in one place)
    2. It's easier to change (You can change value in one place instead of searching for all occurrences)
    3. It's easier to find all usages
    4. It will remove typos
